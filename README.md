## Synopsys

vSelf project was formed around the idea of a libertarian future where people are happy to coexist not only with other humans but with other sentient beings (including AIs) and, of course, mother nature. We believe that the time has come to start building a reliable interface between person and cyberspace, which will allow us to trust our robotic counterparts. For example, to manage our personal data and facilitate other aspects of our social and economic life.

The only thing we can rely on is the laws of physics. That brings cryptography and multiparty computation protocols to the table as the basis for the construction of self-sovereign systems. According to [cypherpunks manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html), it is enough for humanityâ€™s needs to ensure that it doesn't lose its agency as well as remains in control.
